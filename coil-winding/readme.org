* Coil Winding

Winding coils by hand is never fun. I've managed to make the process
significantly easier for small runs of coils by using some tools
available at the Nottingham Hackspace.

This was laser cut using the laser cutter at Nottingham
Hackspace. It's cut out of 3mm acrylic. The pieces can be stacked
together as an acrylic sandwich and held in place using M3 screws. The
outer parts of the sandwich are circular to make winding a coil easier
on a lathe - a rectangular shape will lead to the wire being snagged
on corners. The larger holes allow the coil to be tied or zip-tied
together prior to unstacking the sandwich. I've produced several 300
turn coils in this way.

The SVG in this directory is path only which makes it easy to export
as DXF and cut on a laser cutter. I've included a PNG for
visualisation purposes only.
