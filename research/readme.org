CQ-TV magazine, issue 33, discuss winding deflection coils for vidicon
tubes on page for. Quite interesting although the table is poorly
typeset and I haven't figured out what it all means yet.

TubeTimeUS shows how to wide a deflection coils for a fairly large CRT
using a toilet roll tube.

- http://www.sparkbangbuzz.com/crt/crt6.htm
demonstrates fairly simple deflection using magnet wire and steel
bolts


- Volume 22 of MIT Radiation Lab series "Cathode Ray Tubes" discusses
  deflection coils for CRTs in detail in Chapter 8.
  - Fig. 8.26 shows different types of air gapped windings
  - Fig. 8.27 shows the magnetic field of lumped windings. nice and
    straight!
